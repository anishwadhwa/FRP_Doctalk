# FRP_Doctalk
Project for Doctalk Interview
This project was started at 13th May 2017 for an interview process at DocTalk. 
TASK:
Get issues for a specifc repository using GitHub API and display them in a recycler view. Use RxJava to compose network calls. Use github to host your code.

Example UX Flow
• Type full repository name (with repository owner and slash), like:ReactiveX/RxJava, square/retroft, orfjackal/retrolambda and so on.
• Pressing search should search for the repository and display its issues in the recycler view if it is a valid repository.

Feel free add any bells and whistles (like error handling, custom UI for cells etc.)

Well, there was a time constraint. This is the first upload. If need be, I shall add the bells and whistles.
All major functionalities have been achieved.
